## Welcome to MobArena Docs!

This is the official documentation for the MobArena datapack made by The_TecnoKing.

## What is MobArena?
It's a Minecraft datapack that aims at providing a Mob Arena-type minigame in a vanilla world, with no need of plugins or mods.  
!!! attention    
    At the moment the datapack is in a pre-release, heavy-development stage. The datapack is incomplete with lots of features missing.  
    Most changes will be made in the `dev` branch, which you can find [here](https://github.com/TheTecnoKing/MobArena/tree/dev).
    If you'd like to check more about the datapack's development status, head over [here](https://github.com/TheTecnoKing/MobArena/projects/2).
